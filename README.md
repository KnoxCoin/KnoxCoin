## Why Knox Coin is Needed

Our team sought to make a more secure blockchain technology accessible to anyone––without requiring the massive investments in infrastructure, management, and trusted third parties that the rich use to make sure their cryptocurrency remains secure.

On current blockchain systems, a user’s private key is their single point of failure. However, this private key is also necessary for every transaction a user wishes to make. For users prioritizing security, we believe this paradox of a private key providing the root of function and the root of security is a fundamental design flaw. Because the user must keep their private key readily available for every transaction, an attacker may more easily steal it by socially engineering the user or hacking the user’s machine. In practice, this accounts for the majority of cryptocurrency stolen each year. We've carefully designed and implemented a basic prototype of a new system called Knox to protect against private key compromise and vastly improve any user's cryptocurrency security.
